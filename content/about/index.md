# About

_linux-toolkit.com_ is a site dedicated to renewing the outdated Linux program
manuals from a modern perspective, aiming to eventually cover a wider range of
CS concepts and tools. The site provides examples and workflow strategies for
both new users as well as those simply needing a quick reference. Please let me
know if you have any suggestions, comments, or if you catch a mistake that needs
quick fixing! You can find me on GitHub [here](https://github.com/amjack100).
