## About

_linux-toolkit.com_ is a site dedicated to renewing the outdated Linux program
manuals with a modern, concise perspective, aiming to eventually cover a wider
range of CS concepts and tools. The site provides examples and
workflow strategies for both new users as well as those simply needing a quick
reference. Please let me know if you have any suggestions, comments,
or if you catch a mistake which needs quick fixing. You can find me on GitHub [here](https://github.com/amjack100).
