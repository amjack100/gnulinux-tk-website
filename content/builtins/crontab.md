`crontab` is used for running [jobs]({{< ref "builtins/jobs.md" >}}) at
scheduled time intervals. <br><br> The name `crontab` comes from "cron" and
"table". A cron table/crontab file is a text file which contains lines of
instructions - 1 instruction per line - of what commands to run and when. <br>

`cron` by itself is also a command - an "always-on" background job which reads
the cron table, executing its lines at the appropriate times. `cron` is
typically not used directly.

## Overview

{{< showIfExists "static/crontab.svg" >}}

Edit the current user's crontab file.

```bash
$ crontab -e
```

List all the cron jobs in the user's crontab file.

```bash
$ crontab -l
```

Remove all the cron jobs in the user's crontab file.

```bash
$ crontab -r
```

### Cron expressions

Cron jobs are specified in the crontab file with a simple syntax. For each line
of the crontab file, the left side represents the time interval and the right
side is the command to be executed.

```bash
#time     command
* * * * * echo abc
```

There are 5 markers seperated by spaces which correspond to 5 different
intervals. Here is a table showing the meaninings of each of the 5 markers in
sequential order, with example values for each:

|     |      Every       |    Every n-th    |     Just one     |     Multiple     |                 Meaning |
| --- | :--------------: | :--------------: | :--------------: | :--------------: | ----------------------: |
|     | <img width=100/> | <img width=100/> | <img width=100/> | <img width=100/> |
| 1st |        \*        |      \*/10       |        30        |      10,20       |     10,20 minute (0-59) |
| 2nd |        \*        |       \*/4       |        12        |       0,12       |             hour (0-23) |
| 3rd |        \*        |       \*/6       |        15        |      20,30       | day of the month (1-31) |
| 4th |        \*        |       \*/5       |        32        |      1,2,3       |            month (1-12) |
| 5th |        \*        |       \*/2       |        3         |       2,4        |   day of the week (0-6) |

<br>
According to the table, the sample cron job above will run `echo abc` every
minute of every hour, every day of the month, every day of the week, and every
month of the year.
