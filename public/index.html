sed &#39;s/old/new&#39; file.txt Write replacement of all matching patterns in a file.

  ln is a tool for creating links between files. It can create the two different types of links: soft/symbolic links and hard links. A soft link is like the equivalent of a Windows shortcut icon. When a program reads a soft link, it is redirected to where the file is. A hard link is basically like giving a file another name. When a program reads a hard link, it reads the exact data block as the original file.

  CMake is a tool that creates build setups for source code, allowing that code to be cross platform.
The root of a CMake entity is always defined by a CMakeLists.txt file.

  chown is a tool for changing the owner of a file or directory. To see the owner of file.txt, use the command ls -l file.txt. The output is:
 -rw-rw-r-- 1 john staff 23 Jul 2 08:45 file.txt  where &ldquo;john&rdquo; is the file&rsquo;s owner. chown is also capable of changing the file group, (in this case &ldquo;staff&rdquo;), doing the exact same thing as chgrp.
Most Common Usages Change the owner of a file.

  chmod is a utility for changing the mode (permissions) of a file or directory. To check the file mode for file.txt, use the command ls -l file.txt. The output is:
 -rw-rw-r-- 1 user group 23 Jul 2 08:45 file.txt  where -rw-rw-r-- is the file&rsquo;s mode.
The first dash is the type of file and is not important. The next 9 dashes are mode bits. A letter (r,w,x) means on and a dash means off.

Most Common Usages Get the disk usage of a single file or directory
du -sh ./directory &hellip; where -sh stands for summarize and human-readable
Get the size of a single file or directory
du -bsh ./directory &hellip;where -b is equal to --apparent-size --block-size=1
Configuration The block size defaults to 1024 bytes but can be modified with the environment variables DU_BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE, or BLOCKSIZE

  tput will output a special value from the terminfo database, given a &ldquo;capname&rdquo; as a key. The terminfo database is a set of key value pairs storing information about hundreds of terminals (+ terminal emulators, given that actual terminals hardly exist today). Terminfo database files are held in /etc/terminfo/ but are compressed and require special tools for reading.
Most Common Usages Write the value of a capname to standard output

  rsync is a copying tool that implements a delta-transfer algorithm for extremely fast and efficient transfers. It finds files that have changed in size or last-modified time to determine the necessary updates to the destination.
If rsync is used over ssh, it requires that both the client and server have the software installed.
    rsync      run directly yes   configuration ~/.ssh/config (if applicable)   service rsyncd.

  ssh is a program for logging into a remote computer and executing commands on that computer. ssh connects and logs into the specified destination, which may be specified as either [user@]hostname or ssh://[user@]hostname[:port]
The user trying to access the remote computer must prove their identity.
Most Common Usages Access a remote machine by providing a private key as input
ssh -i &lt;private key file&gt; &lt;username&gt;@&lt;hostname&gt; For example
ssh -i ~/.ssh/some-private-key.key john@100.

  systemctl is a tool for tapping into systemd, a program which will always be running in the background. systemd calls everything &ldquo;units&rdquo;, which are just files which each maintain a more specialized part of the whole system. There are 11 different types of units. Here are the first two:
 Service units - start and control daemons (programs that run in the background) Socket units - represent &ldquo;sockets&rdquo; which have to do with network connections  Most Common Usages List all the servies systemctl list-units or just systemctl
