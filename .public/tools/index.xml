      <description>insmod and rmmod are programs for respectively inserting modules into the Linux kernel and removing them. The official manual descriptions of both tools recommends the use of modprobe as an alternative way of performing these operations.
 Most users will want to use modprobe(8) instead, which is more clever and can handle module dependencies
&amp;ndash; Manual page insmod(8)
 Most Common Usages Insert a kernel module
sudo insmod module.ko Remove a kernel module</description>

It will check for dependencies, download packages, and use dpkg to install them.

      <guid>http://150.136.68.59/tools/make/</guid>
      <description>make is a tool for organizing a build process for any programming language. Most programming projects involve some of sequential process of compiling source code files using various commands. A hierarchy develops where certain files might depend on the existence of others in order to assure a successful compilation, and therefore a successful program. At its simplest, make stores a list of these commands under a single name a &amp;ldquo;Makefile&amp;rdquo;. With a Makefile, all of these commands can then be run at once, hiding the complexities of the build process and preventing the builder from running potentially hundreds of commands manually over and over again.</description>

      <description>ln is a tool for creating links between files. It can create the two different types of links: soft/symbolic links and hard links. A soft link is like the equivalent of a Windows shortcut icon. When a program reads a soft link, it is redirected to where the file is. A hard link is basically like giving a file another name. When a program reads a hard link, it reads the exact data block as the original file.</description>

      <description>systemd is the first process run on boot and acts as the manager for all running services (programs which run in the background). The main configuration entities of systemd are simply called &amp;ldquo;units&amp;rdquo;, of which there are 11 different types. The most commonly used unit is the service unit, which are described individually in .service files. There are several commands for tapping into the features of systemd, including systemctl and journalctl, as well as special syntaxes for customizing each of the types of unit files.</description>
