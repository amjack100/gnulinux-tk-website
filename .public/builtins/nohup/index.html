  <p><code>nohup</code> is a shell builtin used for running commands whose processes are able to
run beyond the lifetime of the parent process/processes (shell or terminal
emulator). <br><br> When a command is run from a shell, a parent-child
relationship is formed between the two processes (the shell being the parent and
the command process being the child). If a parent process is stopped, its
children processes are stopped as well. Running a command with <code>nohup</code> prevents
this relationship. Therefore, if the shell process which ran the command is
killed, the command itself continues to run. <br><br> The name <code>nohup</code> comes
from <strong>no</strong> <strong>h</strong>ang<strong>up</strong>, because it runs commands that are immune to hangup
signals (one way the operating system tells a processes to quit).</p>
<h2 id="usage-examples">Usage Examples</h2>
<p>Run a command independent of its parent process.</p>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Using <code>nohup</code> is similar to using <code>disown</code> like so:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ sleep <span style="color:#ae81ff">1000</span> &amp; disown
</code></pre></div><p>except <code>disown</code> will always print output to the terminal, while <code>nohup</code> will
always write output to a file.</p>
