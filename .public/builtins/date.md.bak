`date` is a command for getting and optionally formatting the current date and
time. It can be especially useful for tasks such as logging and naming groups of
files. The slight complexity of `date` lies in its various formatting sequences,
which are numerous and not particularly intuitive at first glance.

## Usage Examples

Get the current date in the default format

```bash
$ date
# Equal to date +%c
```

Log an event with date annotations

```bash
$ echo "[$(date +%F_%T)] Some event occurred" >> log.txt
# Output: [2021-08-17_10:35:07] Some event occurred
```

## Configuration

No configuration, but formats can be predefined with `alias`.

## Notes

The following format sequences describe how the output of `date` can be adjusted
to look a specific way. A sequence is a "%" followed by a single letter. The
different letters produce output based on whether they are lowercase or uppercase,
for example `%a` or `%A`, where the uppercase member will typically expand into
a longer/more verbose descriptor.
